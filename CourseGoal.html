      There is one reason that I am in this course and it is because I need one last elective course to graduate.
      But I chose this coure because it isfront end and to me everything front end is easy and fun to work with.
      In addtiont to that, I chose it because I always wanted to know how webpages are built. This is the first
      time I work with web development and I have zero prior experience but I am liking it so far and it is fun
      as I expected. I hope that I gain enough skills from this couse so that I can build my own website when I
      need to. Another thing is that it is a good skill to gain since a lot of companies are always hiring for
      web development positions.</p>
