    <p> Hi, my name is Moustapha Said. I am a computer science student and I am taking CPSC 349 class as my last class before graduation. My
      next step in the near future is to get a job at one of the big tech comapnies, so that I become one of those people who are reshaping our lives be better and easier using technology.
      For my hobbies I love to do a lot of things such as swimming, playing video games, playing soccer, fishing, playing pool and working out.
      That is a bit about my current life and expected future.
